Thinking of growing houseplants? Here are some easy tips to grow your own indoor garden!

1. The best way to check for moisture is to feel the soil. Remember to water more in the warmer seasons.

2. Over-watering is worse than under-watering.

3. Make sure to consider the lighting of a spot in your room and buy an appropriate plant. Many times I have accidentally bought a plant for my windowsill and it actually needs to be in indirect sunlight.
