Today, I made some delicious pasta.

I diced up some onions, carrots, celery and potatoes, and simmered them in some chicken stock. Then, I added small tube pasta, however I’m sure anything smaller than penne would work! Then, I added the zest of a lemon and lots of grated parmesan. I tend to add too much cheese but the dish really benefitted from the salty flavour of the parm. In the past, I have added cannellini beans and it made for a hearty winter warmer. You can make it vegan by switching out the chicken stock for vegetable stock, too!

This pasta dish was absolutely delicious, I would highly recommend it as a weeknight meal. It’s so easy to size up and size down, too! What's your favourite pasta recipe?
