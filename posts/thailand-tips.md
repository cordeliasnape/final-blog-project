Recently, I travelled to the beautiful country of Thailand. I was so inspired by my trip that I decided to create this blog!

Here are my top tips for your upcoming Thailand trip:

1. Pack your sunscreen! Even though Thailand can be cloudy, it’s best to be safe and wear UV protection. You can get burnt through the clouds!

2. Take lots of small notes in cash! Things are cheap here and handing over the equivalent of £50 for a 7/11 ham and cheese toastie is quite embarrassing! I would know.

3. Buy mosquito repellent when you’re there. It can be very pricey in touristy areas, however, it’s usually more effective because it’s formulated against Thai mosquitos. Not a proven fact as far as I know, but just what I heard!

Thanks for reading my first post! What's your favourite travel destination?
